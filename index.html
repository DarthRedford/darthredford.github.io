                <p>Was it not because of these that Solomon the king of Israel sinned?—Neh. 13:26.
In Nehemiah’s day, Israelite men were marrying foreign women. (Neh. 13:23-25, 27) During his first visit to Jerusalem, Nehemiah had all the older men sign a written agreement pledging that they would not marry pagans. (Neh. 9:38; 10:30) A few years later, however, he found that not only had Jewish men taken foreign wives but they were about to lose their very identity as God’s sanctified people! The children of these foreign women could not read or speak Hebrew. When they got older, would they identify themselves as Israelites? Or would they rather think of themselves as Ashdodites, Ammonites, or Moabites? Without knowing the Hebrew language, was it likely that they would be able to understand God’s Law? How could they get to know Jehovah and choose to serve him instead of the false gods their mothers worshipped? Swift and decisive action was needed, and Nehemiah took such action.—Neh. 13:28. w13 8/15 1:16</p></div>

                <h3>Tuesday, June 2</h3>
                <p>Happy is that slave if his master on arriving finds him doing so.—Matt. 24:46.
In the part of his prophecy that is recorded at Matthew 24:29–25:46, Jesus focuses primarily on what will happen during these last days and during the coming great tribulation. There, Jesus makes eight references to his “coming,” or arrival. Regarding the great tribulation, he states: “They will see the Son of man coming on the clouds.” “You do not know on what day your Lord is coming.” “At an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.” And in his parable of the sheep and the goats, Jesus states: “The Son of man arrives in his glory.” (Matt. 24:30, 42, 44; 25:31) Each of these four references applies to Christ’s future coming as Judge. Indeed, a consideration of Jesus’ prophecy in its entirety makes it clear that each of the eight references to his coming applies to the future time of judgment during the great tribulation. w13 7/15 1:15, 18</p></div>

                <h3>Wednesday, June 3</h3>
                <p>God is not partial.—Acts 10:34.
How can we imitate Jehovah’s impartiality? Genuine impartiality has two aspects: attitude and actions. Only if we are impartial will we treat others without partiality. Yet, it is not always easy to evaluate our own feelings objectively. So, what could we do to find out if we are known as being unbiased? Well, when Jesus was interested in knowing what people were saying about him, he asked his trusted friends: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?” (Matt. 16:13, 14) Why not follow Jesus in that? You could ask some friend whom you can count on for candor whether you have a reputation for being impartial. If he or she concedes that there seem to be some lingering traces of racial, social, or economic partiality, what should you do? Pray earnestly to Jehovah about your feelings, begging him to help you adjust your attitude so that it will reflect his impartiality to a fuller degree.—Matt. 7:7; Col. 3:10, 11. w13 6/15 1:11, 16</p></div>
